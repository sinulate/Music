Lyrics Prompt

[Intro]
(A sparse, melancholic grand piano melody, played with a soft touch. Each note has a long, natural decay. A single, sorrowful, virtuosic acoustic violin note hangs in the air, full of longing.)

[Verse 1]
(Vocals enter: high-pitched female singer with a Japanese accent. Her delivery is extremely breathy, close-mic'd, and fragile. The only accompaniment is the sparse piano.)
Eye couldn't wait four yoo too come and clear the cupboards
But now yor gone and leaving nuthin but a sine
Another evening, aisle be sittin reading in-between yor lines
Cuz Eye miss you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
(The piano chords become slightly fuller. The violin re-enters, playing a subtle, weeping counter-melody that weaves around the vulnerable vocal line, adding a layer of heartbreak.)
Sew, get away
Another way too feel wut you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
Yoo no you didn't lose yor self-control
Lets start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be wear you didn't want yourself to go
And let yourself go
Is that uh compromise?

[Chorus]
(The emotional intensity swells gently. The violin becomes more prominent, soaring with sorrow but never overpowering the vocal. The piano plays fuller, more resonant chords.)
So, what do you wonna do? What's yor point of view?
Thairs a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with yoo, what's yor point of view?
Eye'm on top of yoo, I don't wonna go
Cuz Eye realy wonna stay at your house
And Eye hope this works out
But yoo no how much yoo broke me apart
Eye'm dun with yoo, Eye'm ignoring you
I don't wonna know

[Verse 2 - The Cracks Begin to Show]
(The instrumentation strips back again to just the sparse piano. Her voice starts to show a slight, audible tremble, as if she is on the verge of tears.)
And Eye'm aware that yoo we're lying in the gutter
Cuz Eye did everything to bee there buy yor side
So, wen you tell me Eye'm the reason, Eye just can't believe the lies
And why do Eye still want to call you? (Her voice wavers and cracks on the final word "you")

[Chorus 2 - The Struggle]
(She struggles through this chorus. Her breathy delivery is now shaky and strained, clearly fighting back tears. The violin melody becomes more urgent and sorrowful in response to her pain.)
So, what do you wonna do? What's yor point of view?
Thairs a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with yoo, what's yor point of view?
Eye'm on top of yoo, I don't wonna go
Cuz Eye realy wonna stay at your house
And Eye hope this works out
But yoo no how much yoo broke me apart
Eye'm dun with yoo, Eye'm ignoring you
I don't wonna know

[Bridge - The Breaking Point]
(The music becomes almost silent, just a single, shimmering, sustained grand piano chord hanging in the air to create a vacuum of sound.)

[Vocal Breakdown (Crying Solo)]
(A sharp, hitched breath is heard, followed by the raw, non-lyrical, standalone sound of quiet, heartbreaking crying for several seconds. No words are spoken or sung.)

[Final Chorus - The Catharsis]
(Directly following the crying, a massive, heartbreaking swell of sound crashes in. The violin soars to its highest, most gut-wrenching emotional peak. The piano is rich and full. The vocals return, no longer crying, but sounding fragile, exhausted, and distant, layered in heavy, ethereal reverb.)
So, what do you wonna do? What's yor point of view?
Thairs a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with yoo, what's yor point of view?
Eye'm on top of yoo, I don't wonna go
Cuz Eye realy wonna stay at your house
And Eye hope this works out
But yoo no how much yoo broke me apart
Eye'm dun with yoo, Eye'm ignoring you
I don't wonna know

[Outro]
(The track deconstructs beautifully. The violin holds a final, sorrowful note that fades away, leaving only the sparse piano melody. The piano plays the final phrase slowly, before ending on a single, sustained note that rings out into a long, silent decay.)



Positive Style Prompt

Emotional Cinematic Sadcore, Acoustic Ballad, Anime Soundtrack. A purely acoustic, "unplugged" performance. The sound is pristine, intimate, and deeply atmospheric, as if recorded in a world-class concert hall to capture natural acoustics.  
The only instrumentation is a masterful grand piano and a virtuosic, masterful acoustic violin. The violin is the lead, playing weeping, sorrowful, and expressive melodies.  
The song's emotional centerpiece is a meticulously orchestrated, non-lyrical event: a `[Vocal Breakdown (Crying Solo)]` featuring the raw, standalone sound effect of audible, heartbreaking crying. The lead vocal is a high-pitched, ethereal female singer with a Japanese accent, and her performance is extremely breathy, fragile, and vulnerable.



Negative Style Prompt

Lyrics Prompt

[Intro - High-Definition Separation]
[Silence. A pristine acoustic space. The instruments are panned clearly: Piano Left, Violin Right.]
[The Duel Starts Immediately: Rapid, percussive staccato notes traded between the instruments.]
(Spoken Softly - Dry, single voice, extremely close-mic)
"A touch... of string theory."

[Verse 1]
[The accompaniment is sparse and rhythmic to allow vocal separation.]
(Vocals: Single dry track. No reverb. Young female tone (21). Very airy, breathy, and distinct. Short, spoken-word style phrasing.)
Open my mouth.
To breathe the words.
To yew.
(Piano: A single, crystal-clear staccato chord)
The words just won't come out.
So I write.
(Violin: Sharp spiccato pluck)
Write on the can-vas.
Built from feel-ing.
E-motion.
Per-se-ver-ing.
In-side.

[Pre-Chorus - The Kinetic Build]
[A dry snare roll begins to speed up. The Violin switches to fast, anxious bowing.]
(Vocals: Breathless, urgent, distinct single voice)
It's just...

[Drop 1 - Symphonic Liquid Clarity]
[Impact: A punchy, clean Liquid DnB beat drops at 174 BPM. Deep Reese Bass is centered.]
[The Duel: The Piano and Violin play complex rolling arpeggios that sit WIDE in the mix, leaving the center clear for the singer.]
(Vocals: Powerful belt, but kept short and punchy. No harmonies.)
One touch to open.
One touch to close.
(Violin: Rapid, sharp descending scale)
One touch to show me.
Not awl minds are cold.
(Piano: Hard, percussive strike)
One touch to loo-sen.
Loo-sen the hold.
One touch to free me...
From fall-ing down on my own... own.

[Instrumental Duel - The Staccato Battle]
[Vocals cut out completely. The focus is purely on the instruments.]
(Violin: Aggressive Spiccato bowing - short, sharp, rhythmic stabs)
(Piano: Matches with percussive, staccato block chords)
(Violin: Suddenly switches to a fluid, rolling 32nd-note arpeggio)
(Piano: Answers with a cascading jazz run)
[They lock into a synchronized, high-speed polyrhythm over the breakbeat.]

[Verse 2]
[Sudden contrast. Drums drop to a light rim-shot. Bass remains deep.]
(Vocals: Return to Dry, ASMR-style whisper. Short notes.)
Just...
One touch to open.
One touch to close.
(Violin: Delicate pizzicato plucks)
One touch to show me.
Not awl minds are cold.
One touch to loo-sen.
Loo-sen the hold.
One touch to free me...

[Breakdown - "No Shadow"]
[Complete Silence except for the Single Vocal and a warm Sub-Bass pad.]
(Vocals: Single track, soft and haunting, extremely clear articulation)
No shad-ow.
Darkness.
I am fall-ing no more.
(Piano: Enters with a slow, melancholic melody)
I nev-er felt like this be-fore.
No shad-ow.
Darkness.
I am fall-ing no more.

[Epic Buildup - The Ascent]
[The Snare roll returns, crisp and bright. The Piano and Violin play ascending Staccato scales, accelerating.]
(Vocals: Building from breathy to full power single voice)
I nev-er felt like this be-fore!
I nev-er felt like this be-fore!
I nev-er felt like this be-

[Drop 2 - Final Euphoria]
[Maximum Fidelity. The drums are driving. The Bass is shaking the floor. The Violin and Piano are shredding.]
(Vocals: Emotional belts, clear and resonant)
This new feel-ing, yeah!
This new feel-ing, yeah!

[Outro - Resolved]
[The Liquid beat filters out.]
(Piano: Plays the main theme one last time, slowing down)
(Violin: A final, sharp pizzicato note)
[Ritardando]
[Final Chord: A clean, resolved Piano chord decays into silence.]
